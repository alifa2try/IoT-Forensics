#### Paragraph 1
- This applies to energy-based railway systems such as UP to passenger based railway systems such as Amtrak. (MAKE SURE WE ARE TOTALLY ACCURATE)
- Critical part of infrastructure, that we presume it's secure
- Do not think about trains everyday and how they are a part of our critical infrastructure
#### Paragraph 2
- Look at inner workings of train onboard systems in the US 
- We have an interest in how things work behind the scenes and reverse engineering backdoors and finding vulnerabilities 
#### Paragraph 3

- Physical attacks, natural disasters
