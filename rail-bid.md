### Reason for wanting this project:

(1-3 paragraphs about why the team is interested in this project. Focus on the interesting aspects of the project and how the team matches well to the project area)
- #### Notes 
#### Paragraph 1 (AL)
- This applies to energy-based railway systems such as UP to passenger based railway systems such as Amtrak. (MAKE SURE WE ARE TOTALLY ACCURATE)
- Critical part of infrastructure, that we presume it's secure
- Do not think about trains everyday and how they are a part of our critical infrastructure
#### Paragraph 2 (AM)
Considering the ubiquity use of railway and train systems, it would be very engaging to look at the different systems used. In comparison of the older steam engine trains, today’s train systems have more advanced efficiency, such as braking and passenger information systems. These different components play a significant role in the entire system and must communicate accurately. We as a group would want to take a position from a security/network analyst or ethical hacker point-of-view and work behind the scenes. Depending on the resources provided for the project, we would attempt to reverse engineer backdoors and analyze communications between different components, among other vulnerabilities. Within such a large system of interconnected devices, it would be a focal point for us to analyze the individual components and ensure communications between them are both efficient and secure. 
#### Paragraph 3 (EH)
- Talk about possible attacks?
- Before trains would have to worry about train robbers, and now robbers aren't physically there. 
- Physical attacks, natural disasters



### Project Scope:

End goal: Identify potentially high-risk vulnerabilities to these systems so that freight trains can continue to safely serve the nation.

In this project, take an all-inclusive look into the train's on-board systems, the rail systems themselves and the command and control systems that bring it all together.

(2-3 paragraphs about what the project work will entail and what outcomes are to be expected. This should be a sort of “executive summary” that overviews what the initial plans are for the team)

### Qualifications:

This Capstone team consists of three graduate and two undergraduate students that possess a variety of skills from several fields including software development, digital and network forensics, system administration, penetration testing, and vulnerability analysis.
