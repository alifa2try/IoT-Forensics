## Summary and Merit of Project
1. A problem statement identifying relevant issues related to your bid. The problem statement might also discuss why these issues are a problematic for society, a particular industry/sector/company/agency, or a specific technology(ies).
1. Project goals and objectives in a numbered or bulleted list that you propose to undertake to address the identified problem. Clearly identify what you are doing at a high level with minimal technical detail.
1. The merit of accomplishing the project goals and objectives in terms of how it helps end users, society, or particular industries/sectors/companies/agencies.

### Goals and objectives

*Research differences/similarities of traditional forensics, in comparison to IOT

## Proposed Project Timeline

An important part of project planning is identifying tasks to be completed to address project goals and arranging those tasks in such a way that they can be completed within a (typically) fixed interval of time. In this class, that interval is the length of the semester. For milestone one, prepare an overall project timeline that identifies large tasks to be completed, estimates time of completion, and arranges those tasks chronologically over the project lifespan.

## Risk list
As you will probably discover, there are many things that can go wrong when working on a project. Issues with skillsets, technology, team member availability, etc, may arise as the project goes forward. As we discussed in class, there are three options available to deal with project management risks: monitor it (Watch it), mitigate it (do something about it), accept it (give up). For milestone one, you should identify the major sources of risk and what you plan to do about them. Prepare a risk list and rank them by risk level using the standard formula, i.e. `impact x likelihood`, to describe the top 5 risks that might affect your team's ability to pull off the tasks identified in your timeline and dictated by your objectives.

|Risk name  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Some risk (40) | 8 | 5 | Some description  |


*Maybe not enough information since IOT kinda new and there is a variety of IOT devices now in days?

## Project Methodology
Methodology is extremely important for conducting a successful project. While I am always a fan of "winging it" when it comes to day-to-day life - winging it is not an option for being successful on a team. Hence, in this class you will be required to develop a technical plan (AKA `Methodology`) to succeed. Your methodology should be grounded in scientific method and best practice. It should be based on the literature in the area you are working on and should use well-tested methods when possible.

Requirements are extremely important for conducting a successful project - of either the creative or assessment-oriented varieties. Collecting requirements about an application means understand what your end user (or what the end user of a product you are assessing) is going to do with the product. To understand requirements we often define user stories and use cases to encapsulate and represent behavior.

#### Literature Review
For milestone 1, you should prepare a literature review document that surveys the various research and development work in your project area. Your literature review should identify important `keywords`, relevant `research papers`, and `the state of the art` in your area.


#### Technical Plan
Once you have examined the relevant literature, you should prepare a technical plan that outlines and defines your methodology. Important consideration should be made to ensure that your methodology uses the literature to the best extent possible. Your technical plan should provide a detailed description of exactly what and how you will do what you plan to do.

## Resources Needed
Every team needs *something* to pull off their project. Clearly identify the technologies and products involved in your project.

Under your requirements section in the README.md file in your GitHub repo, clearly identify the technologies, products, and languages involved in your project. Include a table that identifies which team member will investigate each needed resource. Also include a column indicating whether or not material resources are needed from Dr. Hale.

|Resource  | Dr. Hale needed? | Investigating Team member | Description |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
|Some resource| No | Bob | Some description  |
|e.g. PLC unit | Yes | Gary | A programmable logic controller from Siemens for investigation.|

## First Sprint Plan
This milestone represents the first step forward in your capstone project. As part of that effort, you need to plan your first real sprint.
This part of the milestone is strictly captured by GitHub Projects (its a `Kanban` board technology like Trello). In your Kanban board, create a board following the structure discussed in class (see Lecture 4). Use this structure to identify the tasks that you will tackle in your first sprint. Put those tasks in the **Sprint To-do** category.


## Teamwork
Lastly, it is important that you realize you are working on a TEAM (except for the few of you that are soloing). I will say now, that your grade is dependent on your participation. I will not allow individuals to sluff off on a team. Your grade is therefore based partly on a *participation factor*. Essentially if you don't participate (and trust me We will know) - you will not get all of the team points on your project grade.
