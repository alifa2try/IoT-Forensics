## Executive Summary
The Internet of Things (IoT) intersects with every aspect of modern life from industry to agriculture, education to entertainment, and medicine to law enforcement. With the ubiquity of IoT devices, it is imperative that forensic investigators can reliably gather data and maintain its integrity throughout the course of an investigation. Currently, there exists no defined and accepted standard for IoT forensic investigations. This can be attributed in part to the heterogeneous nature of IoT. Nearly every class of IoT device integrates its own hardware and software, data storage techniques, and network solutions differently. Even devices from the same category can vary in design and functionality. For example, Google and Amazon both produce home assistants. However, Google Home operates best as an in-house search engine while the Amazon Echo facilitates convenient online shopping. The nature and purpose of the device will also have an effect on the data that can be gathered; wearables and smart appliances will not generate the same types or volume of data. The data these devices gather and generate may be stored locally or on the cloud, compounding the complexity of the data acquisition process.

IoT forensics is still an emerging field due in part to the aforementioned reasons. This makes introducing evidence gathered from IoT devices in court difficult as investigators cannot point to best practices and precedent to show their evidence is sound. Many of the existing frameworks for forensics and IoT forensics are very similar to one another. They focus on a few core principles and differences from traditional forensics to IoT forensics. As a result we've decided to focus more on the practical application of IoT forensics with hands on experiments, and have shifted away from developing our own framework.

## Project Goals
- Review state of the art research and standards concerning IoT forensic and traditional digital forensics.  
- Compare and contrast IoT forensic techniques with those of traditional digital forensics standards.  
- Identify the driving factors of the slow maturation of IoT forensic standards and possible solutions.  
- Apply recommended standards gathered from IoT forensic literature in hands-on experiments to test their effectiveness across multiple IoT devices.  
- Provide educated recommendations on developing and establishing IoT forensic standards, research, and areas that merit further study.

## Project Methodology
We started our project by conducting a review of the current literature and standards related to IoT forensic data acquisition. Additionally, we examined traditional digital forensics techniques and compared and contrasted them to current IoT forensics standards. The review provided insight on the current state of IoT forensics and which allowed us to identify outstanding issues in the field.

We examined and selected technical procedures to use and reference as we move into the hands-on portion of our project.  We will refer to the processes and procedures presented in the Computer Forensics Technical Procedure Manual (North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation) and the Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement (US Department of Justice).   

The second half of our project focused on hands-on experimentation with IoT devices. This allowed us to fully understand the forensic and data acquisition processes. Lastly, using the knowledge we gained from the literature review and hands-on application, we will present our research, and refinements to IoT forensics moving forward.

#### Milestone 2 outcomes
Our project objectives have changed based upon our research. We discovered that many of the existing frameworks for forensics and IoT forensics are very similar to one another. They focus on a few core principles and differences from traditional forensics to IoT forensics. As a result we've decided to focus more on the practical application of IoT forensics with hands on experiments, and shift away from developing our own framework.
