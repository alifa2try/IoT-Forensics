### Reason for wanting this project:

Living in the world of technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming the more and more popular. Gartner, a global research company, predicts that by 2020, there will be 20.4 billion IoT devices deployed.<sup>1</sup>  The idea of IoT brings many new abilities for a user aiming to improve or make a task easier through a certain device. From internet connected wearable watches for fitness tracking, to home security systems. The rise of IoT devices creates an immense impact in the field of forensics. IoT devices bring about  a new source for data collection that could be beneficial to an investigator in solving a case.

Our group has previously had exposure to this field through a digital forensics course at our university. In this class we learned about the different aspects and tools for digital forensics such tools included FTK (Forensic Tool Kit), FTK Imager, and Scalpel. Moving forward to advance our knowledge, we would like to further apply ourselves to look over different IoT devices since similarities should exist. In addition, we need to point out that IoT devices can have negative effects. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has highlighted ten different vulnerabilities such as poor physical security and insecure software/firmware about the Internet of Things.<sup>2</sup> Within this subject, we would be interested in not only bringing out previous experiences upon the project, but also expand our knowledge of digital/IoT forensics. 

### Project Scope:
  
As we see an increase in IoT devices throughout the upcoming years, it’s important that government agencies and public organizations have a framework to reference. Organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provide documentation for best practices, which help standardize the forensics industry. These documents will help to guide our research and outline the framework. 

The framework will be based upon traditional forensics in the computer field but will take special considerations for IoT devices. We will survey recent history of events related to IoT devices to help construct our IoT specific framework. Additionally, we will conduct our own analysis of IoT devices to provide hands on experience to our framework. Thus, our goal will be to provide a review and analysis on the work done in this field and help share our ideas as we continue to learn more about the Internet of Things.
