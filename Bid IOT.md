### University:
University of Nebraska-Omaha

### Faculty Advisor:
Dr. Matt Hale

### Project:
IOT Forensics

### Project Agency (optional):
National Security Agency

### Technical Director / External Customer:
Albert Holt

### Reason for wanting this project:

Living in the world of technology, the Internet of Things (IOT) is becoming the more and more popular. The idea of IOT brings a lot of new abilities to a user in hopes of improving or making a task easier through a certain device. From internet connected TV’s to internet connected home security systems. [One team member uses several IOT devices in their home such as Philips Hue Smart Home Lighting, Google Home, and a SmartThings Hub] Every year more devices are added to the Internet of Things, each with their own security concerns and digital artifacts. Understanding IOT devices' behavior and artifacts will allow us to help increase their security and how to examine them forensically. 

We selected this project because of our collective experience with the forensics course at UNO.  The course is based upon classical techniques and embraces new technology from enterprise and open source tools. Our experience in the class has given us the foundation to examine different types of IOT devices available. Choosing this project will allow us to expand our knowledge and contribute to the forensics field. 

### Project Scope:

(2-3 paragraphs about what the project work will entail and what outcomes are to be expected. This should be a sort of “executive summary” that overviews what the initial plans are for the team)



*Brief Notes [still working on this -ronald]

Goal: Compare both traditional/classical forensics to IoT stuff
- research any similarities (i'm sure similarities from IoT devices go hand and hand with your typical/classical forensics since some of these devices are usually connected to a network or some sort of central hub

stuff we would look at/report on:
- mainly research IoT devices and see any previous work done by others if any on this matter
- continue to compare it to the typical/classical forensics 

### Qualifications:

* Elisabeth Henderson is an undergraduate majoring in Cybersecurity and minoring in Computer Science. She is working in conjunction with the Cybersecurity Department Director to create a specialized assembly language programming competition. In addition she also works as a tutor for computer science classes. She has experience in classical forensics and reverse engineering.
* Ashley Leedom is an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Cybersecurity with a minor in Computer Science.  She has worked as an intern in Union Pacific's Authentication and Authorization team where she developed secure web applications and analyzed network peripherals for vulnerabilities.  Relevant skills include proficiency in several programming languages and reverse-engineering applications, familiarity with network forensics, and the ability to work cohesively in a team.
