### Project:
Internet of Things (IoT) Forensics

### Project Agency (optional):
National Security Agency

### Technical Director / External Customer:

### Reason for wanting this project:

Living in the world of technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming the more and more popular. Gartner, a global research company, predicts that by 2020, there will be 20.4 billion IoT devices deployed.<sup>1</sup>  The idea of IoT brings many new abilities for a user aiming to improve or making a task easier through a certain device. From internet connected wearable watches for fitness tracking, to home security systems. The rise of IoT devices are having a huge effect in the field of forensics. IoT devices brings a new source of data collection that could be beneficial to an investigator in solving a case.

Our group has previously had exposure to this field through a forensics course at our university. The course was based upon the traditional techniques of digital forensics. The experience from this class gives us the ability in to examine different types of digital devices that include the IoT because of the similarities that go hand and hand with the traditional aspects. We’d also like to point out that IoT devices have negative effects that are important to acknowledge. The Open Web Application Security Project, known as OWASP, has highlighted ten different vulnerabilities such as poor physical security and insecure software/firmware about the Internet of Things.<sup>2</sup> We’d like to continue our knowledge from our previous experiences by examining this subject and overall help contribute to the field of IoT forensics. 

### Project Scope:
  
As we see an increase in IoT devices throughout the upcoming years, it’s important that government agencies and public organizations have a framework to reference. There are current organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) which provide documentation which are known best practices, geared toward guiding forensic investigations down an ethical path. We will provide an analysis of current work in the forensics field, specifically related to IoT devices and create a framework based upon this. 

The framework will be based upon traditional forensics in the computer field but will take special considerations for IoT devices. We will survey recent history of events related to IoT devices to help construct our IoT specific framework. Additionally, we will conduct our own analysis of IoT devices to provide hands on experience to our framework. Thus, our goal will be to provide a review and analysis on the work done in this field and help share our ideas as we continue to learn more about the world of the Internet of Things.
