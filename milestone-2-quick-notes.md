**Authors:** Jeffrey Cichonski, Jeffrey Marron, Nelson Hastings  
**Date Published:** February 2019 (draft)  
**Published In:** [NIST website](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/iot-sensor-security)  
**Summary:** The Internet of Things (IoT) universe is continuously evolving and expanding as new products and technologies are introduced to the marketplace. IoT sensor networks—networks of small devices, or nodes that detect, analyze, and transmit physical data—are a prime example of this ongoing evolution. The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are partnering to develop a project to protect building management systems' IoT sensor networks.  
**Notes:**  This paper is not quite as on topic as previously thought for IoT forensics. It does have plenty of references to the topic and possible frameworks, however the paper is geared more towards a architecture overview for sensor networks and scenarios which theoritically test those networks. I think it will be good to reference while establishing what things should be checked in a IoT forensics framework.

**Summary:** The authors of this literature begin to discuss the security and forensics challenges in the world of IoT. A few of the challenges the authors expand on are aspects such as authentication, privacy, and evidence identification, collection, and preservation. The authors then go on to conclude their literature with solutions they referenced from other publish papers.    
**Notes:**  Some things to talk about, because of the widespread of IoT devices which college and transfer data, security plays a big challenge. Security challenges mentioned in the reading : Authentication and Privacy.  

1. **A Generic Digital Forensic Investigation Framework for Internet of Things (IoT)**  
**Authors:** Victor R. Kebande and Indrakshi Ray  
**Date Published:** September 26, 2016  
**Published In:** 2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud (FiCloud)  
**Summary:** Kebande and Ray have developed a generic IoT forensic investigation framework that reliably supports digital investigations in IoT-based infrastructures. The framework complies with the ISO/IEC 27043:2015 international standard and provides a promising baseline for IoT forensic investigations.  
**Notes:** This paper compares existing models of digital forensics and IoT forensics - It has 3 categories of IoT forensics: Cloud, Network, and Device forensics. The Cloud forensics focuses on data generated in the cloud environment. Network forensics focuses on the communications of IoT devices. Device level forensics focuses on the digital evidence contained on the IoT devices, like memory, audio or video. 3 frameworks are compared against the proposed framework: Oriwo, Zawoad & Husan, and Perumal.

1. **IoT Forensic: Bridging the Challenges in Digital Forensic and the Internet of Things**  
**Authors:** Nurul Huda Nik Zulkipli, Ahmed Alenezi and Gary B. Wills   
**Date Published:** January 2017    
**Published In:** Conference: 2nd International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security 2017  
**Summary:** In this paper, the authors mention how these smart devices are used in many domains such as homes, transportation, and healthcare. However, these devices could be easily attacked because of the low-security mechanisms implemented and as a result could compromise legitimate data in an investigation. In order to help combat this issue, the authors propose two different approaches for the pre-investigation and implementation phases in forensics.  
**Notes:** This paper has great information on IoT forensics challenges that helps outline the difficulties in IoT. Some of the challenges mentioned are the following: The Investigation Framework, Diversity of Devices, and Lack of Standardization. The authors also talk about the sources of threats in IoT devices, which could help us during our Milestone 3 part of this project.   

1.  **Internet of Things Forensics: Challenges and Approaches**  
**Authors:** Edewede Oriwoh, David Jazani, Gregory Epiphaniou, and Paul Sant  
**Date Published:** 2013  
**Published In:** 9th IEEE International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing  
**Summary:** This paper mentions the various issues, threats, and attacks relating to IoT devices. It presents a realistic scenario of a malicious individual taking advantage of digital devices, including IoT devices. Important and relevant questions are asked as to how to respond and investigate the crime committed. Afterward it states the issues between traditional and IoT digital forensics, and follows with a recommended approach to handling the IoT devices.  
**Notes:** This paper is great for referencing a realistic scenario that involves many devices and really shows how complicated the investigation can get. It also has a few useful tables with information about traditional and IoT digital forensics.

1. **IoT Forensics: Challenges For the IoA Era**  
**Authors:** Aine MacDermott, Thar Baker, and Qi Shi  
**Published In:** 2018 9th IFIP International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)  
**Summary:** The authors coined a definition for IoT in the paper focusing on the interconnected infrastructur and utilities of existing devices among the existing Internet infrastructure. Issues are broadly defined for IoT forensics as being volume, variety, and velocity. The paper focuses on challenges of investigating crime scenes that involve IoT devices, such as the size of the object, location, relevance, legal/jurisdiction issues, blurry network boundaries/edgeless networks, and avaialble tools. Issues are presented in this paper with different categories of IoT based devices.  
**Notes:** The paper gives a good look at IoT forensics from an investigator point of view and presents numerous examples and issues with IoT forensics. 

1. **Internet of Things: The Need, Process Models, and Open Issues**  
**Authors:** Maxim Chernyshev, Sherali Zeadally, Zubair Baig, and Andrew Woodward  
**Published In:** IT Professional (Volume: 20, Issue: 3, May./Jun. 2018)  
**Summary:** This paper speaks about the complexity of extracting information from IoT devices. It can be uncertain where data is originating, where and how it is stored, and data attributes. The IoT infrastructure also can make it difficult to abide by standards in having a chain of custody since data can be very volatile and complex transit routes of the devices happen. Some traditonal forensic methods and techinques that are used for standard digital forensics may be very difficult to apply to IoT forensics. For example, carving (searching for specific content in an extracted file system image) could be difficult as many IoT devices, rely on flash memory and have no built-in filesystem storage capacity. There is a lack of consistency in format that it can be difficult to produce human-readable evidence.  
**Notes:** The paper also includes an example in 2016 of a DoS attack against Dyn domain name servers that occurred from IoT devices. This occurred due to their vulnerabilities being exploited. The attack affected traffic to popular sites such as Twitter, Spotify, and Reddit.

1. **Application-Specific Digital Forensics Investigative Model in Internet of Things (IoT)**  
**Authors:** Tanveer Zia, Peng Liu, Weili Han  
**Date Published:** Aug-Sep 2017  
**Published In:** Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security Article No. 55  
**Summary:** This material evaluates the quickly growing field of IoT devices and the difficulties that arise when trying to find forensic evidence among the devices. It looks at three different IoT device: Smart home (Nest Smart Thermostat), Wearables (VitalPatch), and Smart City (Intelligent Traffic Management System or ITMS of Verizon). It explains the type of data transferred to the relevant devices and difficulties in trying to extract the data. For example, the Smart Home device can communicate between itself, a mobile app, and to a cloud. Material from the Wearables section may apply to the hands-on section of our project.  
**Notes:** Nice summary of IoT forensics in contrast to  the traditional sense. They specifically mention the different storage media in IoT devices - which could present a challenge on our framework design as well. They include a table of data extraction methods I think would be useful to our research as well. They also propose categorizing the forensics as application-specific forensics, digital forensics, and forensics processes which I think is an interesting approach. 

1. **Framework for a Digital Forensic Investigation**  
**Authors:** Michael Kohn, Jan Eloff, and Martin Oliver  
**Date Published:** July 5 2006  
**Published In:** ISSA 2006 from Insight to Foresight Conference  
**Proposed Framework:** This framework consists of three stages: Preparation, Investigation, and Presentation. Preparation involves gathering the resources necessary to conduct an investigation, including notifying the relevant authorities and obtaining warrants. The Investigation stage consists of acquiring the devices, conducting an investigation, and analyzing data. The Presentation stage requires investigators to present their findings to the relevant audiences and documenting the investigation.  
**Notes:** Overall, the framework is rather simple. It was designed to not be bogged down by technical details, but to instead remain adaptable. This is one of the oldest frameworks we've examined, so it's a great reference point to demonstrate how far the field has come.  

1. **Systematic Digital Forensic Invesitgation Model**  
**Authors:** Ankit Agarwal, Megha Gupta, Saurabh Gupta, Subhash Gupta  
**Date Published:** January 2011  
**Published In:** International Journal of Computer Science and Security (IJCSS), Volume (5): Issue (1): 2011  
**Proposed Framework:** The Systematic Digital Forensic Invesitgation Model (SDFIM) has 11 cyclical phases: Preparation, Securing the Scene, Survey and Recognition, Documentation of Scene, Communication Shielding, Evidence Collection, Preservation, Examination, Analysis, Presentation, and Review. During the Preparation phase, investigators will gain an initial understanding of the scene and gather the appropriate materials for a forensic investigation. The Securing the Scene phase, investigators lock down the scene. During Survey and Recognition, investigators evaluate the crime scene to determine which devices to capture and analyze; they also conduct intial interviews. Documentation and the chain of custody is initiated in the Documentation of Scene stage. In the Communication Shielding stage, devices are secured in Faraday bags and transported. Volatile and Non-volatile evidence is gathered during the Evidence Collection stage. In the Preservation phase, captured data is stored securely. During the Examination and Analysis phases, data is processed. During the Presentation phase, investigators report their findings to law enforcement and relevant parties. Finally, in the Review phase, investigators review their findings and processes to determine areas of improvement.  
**Notes:** SDFIM is comprehensive, but also cumbersome. It provides several recommendations and elucidates on what events should take place during each step of its execution. This framework is clearly meant to be used by law enforcement agencies to prosecute criminal cases.  

1. **Guide to Integrating Forensics Techniques into Incident Response**  
**Authors:** Karen Kent, Suzanna Chevalier, Tim Grance, and Hung Dang  
**Date Published:** August 2006  
**Proposed Framework (summary):** This is to be used as a guide for organizations working to develop their own forensic plan. They express it should be a starting point to help companies, but it should not be used to guide the execution of a digital forensic investigation and that the organization should consult with legal experts as they create their plan. The guide lays out four basic phases for digital forensics: Collection, Examination, Analysis, and Reporting. In the Collection phase the organization should identify, label, record, and acquire data from relevant sources. In the Examination phase, manual and automatic process should be used to extract and assess data of interest while ensuring the integrity of that data. The Analysis phase uses the data gathered to answer questions that lead to the collection of the data (i.e. Did employee X misuse their computer resources?). Lastly, in the Reporting phase the results of the previous phase, actions taken, tools, techniques, and procedures used should be presented and compiled into a final report. This guide is massive and includes sections on forensic staffing, commonly used media types, filesystems, file headers, volatile data, and so on. This report is 121 pages long with a wealth of information to help guide those looking to add forensic capability to their organization.   
**Notes:** This is not a standard or framework, but it may still be useful to reference throughout our paper as it should be used as a starting point for those inducing forensics into their organization. The report itself is highly referenced and one of the more recent publications on this topic from the US government.   

1. **Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement**  
**Authors:** US Department of Justice  
**Date Published:** April 2004    
**Proposed Framework (summary):** This is a guide for law enforcement officials who will be examining digital evidence. The report starts with considerations for the agency (i.e. Is your agency prepared?) and continues to focus more on a step-by-step guide on collecting, examining, and analyzing digital evidence. It also includes case examples to illustrate the process and include a report that might be generated for that case following the procedure. The phases they lay out are: Policy and Procedure Development, Evidence Assessment, Evidence Acquisition, Evidence Examination, and Documenting and Reporting.   
**Notes:** This document targets law enforcement officials but may be useful to show that the procedures laid out for traditional forensics might not work as well with IoT devices. It gives a step-by-step process that officials should take when confronted with digital evidence.   

1. **Computer Forensics Technical Procedure Manual**  
**Authors:** North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation  
**Date Published:** August 25, 2010  
**Proposed Framework (summary):** This is similar to the DOJ report, but more detailed. Each section gives a breakdown on what the protocol is, its purpose, equipment needed, term definitions, calibrations needed for tools, limitations, the procedure, references, and notes. This is a step-by-step technical guide meant to be used by law enforcement agencies of North Carolina as they investigate crimes with digital evidence.   
**Notes:** As with the DOJ report, it might be useful to have a more technical step-by-step guide to show how current procedures need to be updated for IoT. This is almost 10 years old now, more recent than the DOJ report, but I do not think the procedures vary too much from what they are today. The report mentions many of the same forensic tools we have heard of from class.   

1. **A Comprehensive and Harmonized Digital Forensic Investigation Process Model**  
**Authors:** Aleksandar Valgarevic and Hein S. Venter  
**Date Published:** November 2015  
**Published In:** Journal of Forensic Sciences  
**Proposed Framework (summary):** This paper aims at creating a standardized and formalized process of digital forensics. There are five general classes in the model. Readiness processes, an optional process that works to ensure the company is prepared for forensic investigations, should they need to conduct them. Initialization processes, focused on incident detection, first response, and planning for the digital investigation. Acquisitive processes, focused on the physical scene and collecting the digital evidence. Investigative processes,  which focuses on the actual investigation and the tasks that need to be conducted. The last class of processes is the concurrent processes, which the authors describe as novel. These processes should be conducted throughout the entire investigation, such as obtaining authorization, documentation, managing information flow, preserving the chain of custody and so on. Each process class is broken down further into processes and tasks that need to be done. The paper includes a flow chart to show the relationship between these processes and how the output of each process should flow into the input of the next. Some of these processes, such as those in the readiness process class, as iterative so that they can be returned to if needed (i.e. assessment of implementation shows changes are needed, so the company may need to re-define or re-plan their handling of potential digital evidence). The paper gives great detail to each process class and the processes within while also ensuring the model is abstract so it can be fitted as needed.   
**Notes:** This paper gives a very detailed process model for digital investigations. It is written in abstract terms so that it could be applied to many different situations, including IoT. As one of the more recent papers listed, I think it is a good framework to use as a model going forward in our project. In addition, the authors seem to be pushing for standardization using this model, which just adds more weight to the importance of this model.   

1. **ACPO Good Practice Guide for Digital Evidence**  
**Authors:** The Association of Chief Police Officers  
**Date Published:** March 2012  
**Principles (summary):** The ACPO Guidelines consist of four principles that are fundamental to any forensic investigation. The principles are listed below.  
- **Principle 1:** No action taken by law enforcement agencies, persons employed within those agencies or their agents should change data which may subsequently be relied upon in court.  
- **Principle 2:** In circumstances where a person finds it necessary to access original data, that person must be competent to do so and be able to give evidence explaining the relevance and the implications of their actions.  
- **Principle 3:** An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to digital evidence should be created and preserved. An independent third party should be able to examine those processes and achieve the same result.  
- **Principle 4:** The person in charge of the investigation has overall responsibility for ensuring that the law and these principles are adhered to.  
**Notes:** The ACPO Guidelines were adopted by police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These principles provide guidance for any law enforcement entity that may have to deal with digital evidence. As a result, its recommendations provide an excellent baseline for any forensic framework. We can judge the efficacy of any frameworks we research by analyzing how well they comply with the ACPO guidelines, specifically the principles.
