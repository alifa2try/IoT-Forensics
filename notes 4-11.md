Install apps and interact with device to get data on there
-------------------------------------------------------

4/10/2019
* Went into steal lab. Using Samsung galaxy s4 with android 5.0.1.
* Used Kardia app and device to scan heart rate data. Have to wait 24 hours before being able to scan anything else (has to be reviewed by some cardiologist?)
* Connected garmin hr+ to computer for ftk stuff
    * Could get data from it on ftk. Need to somehow read .fit files
    * Problem: file formats. Need something to interface with .fit files or maybe convert to csvs?
    * Probably related to not using it with gps turned on (when working out it will prompt if we want gps one). Will try to use it a few days with gps on for better results 
* Set up google mini with throwaway gmail account (trowaway4580@gmail.com). Setting up with s4 (had to set up own phone as hotspot because it won’t connect to wifi you have to log in for)
* Google mini will not connect via USB to a computer and be recognizable, will probably have to use whatever data we can try and extract from the s4. 
* Metawear device cannot be connected via USB (port not available). Will wait until Thursday to use some Bluetooth stuff.

Update 4/11/2019
* Met with Grispos and went to his lab to try and retrieve data from the s4 phone. It was found that his tool could not retrieve the planned information
* We will use Nate’s Note 3 phone to put data on throughout the weekend (with the kardia, garmin, etc.) and next week try and get data.
